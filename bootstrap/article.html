                <p>Hollywood has never been shy when it comes to remakes and reboots, milking franchises dry for as much money as possible. And now, it seems that the next franchise to fall prey to this ubiquitous practice is Harry Potter. Rumours have been circulating that Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) are considering rebooting the beloved and record-setting Harry Potter series with an entirely new cast.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6">
                <p>WDW Pro went on to post the following on Valliant Renegade’s channel: “It now seems extremely likely that the Harry Potter universe, which I think internally is called The Wizarding division, it is receiving a reboot in the future in terms of the movies. And that may also include recasting some of the roles that have become iconic inside the Harry Potter universe with the major actors and characters.”</p>
